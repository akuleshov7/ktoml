Fully Native and Multiplatform Kotlin serialization library for serialization/deserialization of [toml](https://toml.io/en/) format.
Uses native [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization), provided by Kotlin. This library contains no Java code and no Java dependencies.
We believe that TOML is actually the most readable and user-friendly **configuration file** format.
So we decided to support this format for the `kotlinx` serialization library.

## How ktoml works: examples

This tool natively deserializes toml expressions using native Kotlin compiler plug-in and [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/docs/serialization-guide.md).

The following example:
```toml
someBooleanProperty = true
# inline tables in gradle 'libs.versions.toml' notation
gradle-libs-like-property = { id = "org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm", version.ref = "kotlin" }

[table1]
# it can be null or nil, but don't forget to mark it with '?' in the codes
# keep in mind, that null is prohibited by TOML spec, but it is very important in Kotlin
property1 = null
property2 = 6
# check property3 in Table1 below. As it has the default value, it is not required and can be not provided 
 
[table2]
someNumber = 5
   [table2."akuleshov7.com"]
       name = 'this is a "literal" string'
       # empty lists are also supported
       configurationList = ["a",  "b",  "c", null]

# such redeclaration of table2
# is prohibited in toml specification;
# but ktoml is allowing it in non-strict mode: 
[table2]       
otherNumber = 5.56

```

can be deserialized to `MyClass`:
```kotlin
@Serializable
data class MyClass(
    val someBooleanProperty: Boolean,
    val table1: Table1,
    val table2: Table2,
   @SerialName("gradle-libs-like-property")
   val kotlinJvm: GradlePlugin
)

@Serializable
data class Table1(
    // nullable values, from toml you can pass null/nil/empty value to this kind of a field
    val property1: Long?,
    // please note, that according to the specification of toml integer values should be represented with Long
    val property2: Long,
    // no need to pass this value as it has the default value and is NOT REQUIRED
    val property3: Long = 5
)

@Serializable
data class Table2(
    val someNumber: Long,
    @SerialName("akuleshov7.com")
    val inlineTable: InlineTable,
    val otherNumber: Double
)

@Serializable
data class GradlePlugin(val id: String, val version: Version)

@Serializable
data class Version(val ref: String)

```

with the following code:
```kotlin
Toml.decodeFromString<MyClass>(/* your toml string */)
```

Translation of the example above to json-terminology:

```json
{
  "someBooleanProperty": true,
  "table1": {
    "property1": 5,
    "property2": 5
  },
  "table2": {
    "someNumber": 5,
    "akuleshov7.com": {
      "name": "my name",
      "configurationList": [
        "a",
        "b",
        "c"
      ],
      "otherNumber": 5.56
    }
  },
  "gradle-libs-like-property": {
    "id": "org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm",
    "version": {
      "ref": "kotlin"
    }
  }
}

```
